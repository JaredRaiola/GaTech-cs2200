Short Answer
----------

lea 	$at, LABEL	!Loads the address of LABEL word into the target address
jalr	$ra, $at	!Jumps to the address of the target address

LABEL: 
	!more code here with no return to the caller

The lea opcode allows us to load in a memory address which can then be accessed by
the jalr opcode call, which will also save a return address in case the callee wants
to return to the caller. If the callee never returns to the return address ($ra), jalr
acts as goto, loading the memory address in $at, with the caveat of $ra needing to be 
reset off either from the stack or set as a new value later.
